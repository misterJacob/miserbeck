            A little bit about myself,
            <br />
            I came to the Canary´s in 2001 working until 2010 in construction
            then i started driving Taxi in the area of Maspalomas. where i have
            been working until 2019 from there i went to work in the reception
            of a hotel in Puerto Rico until it closed down because of the covid
            pandemic, so then what to do? <br />
            😎😎😎
            <br />
            everything here on the island was closed down, I guess I did what a
            lot of people did, started leaning online. I developed a great
            interest in web development, and here is the reason that i have made
            this web site. This is only for Privat use not commercial,
            <br /> Just FUN 😉😁. By the the name MisterBeck come to me actualy
            by coincidence, i was making temp acounts just when i started my lerning of the web development.
            and then i just stuck to it 🤣😂🤣.
