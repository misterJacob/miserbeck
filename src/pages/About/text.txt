A little bit about my self,
i came to the CanaryÂ´s in 2001 working until 2010 in construction then i started driving Taxi in the area of Maspalomas.
where i have been working until 2019 from there i went to work in the reception om Marina elite until it closed down because of the covid pandemic.
So then what to do everything here on the island was closed down, I guess I did what a lot of people did, started leaning online.
I developed a great interest in web development, and here is the reason that i have made this web site.

This is only for Privat use not commercial, Just FUN.
